# ABOUT
ily was made by R. MOUFFOK and me during our bachelor degree. It helps detect radicalization or terrorist acts in REAL TIME using twitter API.
# TOOLS
Python and TWITTER API credentials.
# Scripts
Due to past copyright problems and a misuse of them, our scripts are no longer available publicly.
If your need them for inspiration, educational reasons or more, please email: soffia.nouar@gmail.com describing the use and the purpose.
You must also know that we're not able to share our api credentials with you since we're not allowed to (for project copyright too :D).
You can have your own by making a request on twitter app.
